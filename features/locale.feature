Feature: Locale

    As a user
    I need to be able to change the application locale

Scenario: Change the application language to german
    Given I am not authenticated
    And locale is "en_GB"
    And I am on "/login/"
    When I click "a[data-country-code='de_DE']"
    Then I should see "Benutzername"

Scenario: Change the application language to french
    Given I am not authenticated
    And locale is "en_GB"
    And I am on "/login/"
    When I click "a[data-country-code='fr_FR']"
    Then I should see "Connexion"

Scenario: Change the application language to english
